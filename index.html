    <p style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);font-size: small;">Anthony Bravo said students would be "foolish" not to use AI for work</p>

    <p class="first"> <i>"The tide is coming in. You can't hold it back,"</i>  college principal Anthony Bravo reflects
        on the impact artificial intelligence (AI) is having on teaching and learning. <br>

        Basingstoke College of Technology in Hampshire now teaches its students how to use 
        AI responsibly, including how to recognise AI-generated content. <br>

        Mr Bravo said students would be "foolish" not to use AI for work outside of exam 
        conditions, and the school had a responsibility to teach them how. <br>

        Teachers at the further education college are also using AI to help save time in 
        preparing for lessons.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);font-size: small;">Students learn how to use AI effectively and ethically</p>
        <p>Former students, including Benjamin Miller, first raised concerns about the influence AI was having. <br>

            "I saw my classmates using it and they were using it to basically generate a whole assignment which I spent ten hours doing at home ... in five minutes," he said. <br>
            
            "I was actually quite frustrated about that." <br>
            
            Mr Bravo confirmed some students had handed in work that was at least partially created by AI. <br>
            
            "In the old days, it was much easier because there used to be very good plagiarism devices which could tell if a piece of work had any content which was on the internet," he said. <br>
            
            "Now with AI, because it actually manufactures each piece of work separately, there isn't really any software which can spot it."</p>

        <h2>'Taboo subject'</h2>
        <p> Now, Mr Miller works for the college as a technology assistant, helping both staff and students integrate AI into learning and teaching. <br>

            Students learn the "dos and don'ts" of using AI in the classroom - for example, they can use it to fact check or find a good starting point for their assignment, but they cannot use it to write the assignment or make their bibliography. <br>
            
            Mr Miller said teachers also used it to make presentations and plan their lessons - saving about five hours a week of teaching preparation time. <br>
            
            "Before, it was a taboo subject and students were very scared as well because they didn't know what they were doing - they didn't know how to use it," he said. <br>
            
            "But now it's more like - you should use it because you know it's going to be in your future job, so you should definitely practise using it."</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(110, 110, 110);font-size: small;">Tutor Jack Roche said students needed to be taught how to use AI responsibly

        <p> Staff at the college are aware of the risks of using AI, but tutor Jack Roche said the risks were exactly why students needed to be educated. <br>

            "The con is obvious - are they going to take it a step too far? Are they going to use it to replace the work, replace them, replace the knowledge? <br>
            
            "And that's why we do this... with most things in society, ignoring it is not going to help the problem. <br>
            
            "We have to talk to them and confront them directly," he said. <br>
            
            Mr Bravo agreed that it would be "foolish" for a student not to use AI. <br>
            
            "The tide is coming in. You cannot hold it back, and if you do not take account of it, it will wash over you."</p>
